Description: network management framework (daemon and userspace tools)
 NetworkManager is a system network service that manages your network devices
 and connections, attempting to keep active network connectivity when
 available. It manages ethernet, Wi-Fi, mobile broadband (WWAN), and PPPoE
 devices, and provides VPN integration with a variety of different VPN
 services.
 .
 This package provides the userspace daemons and a command line interface to
 interact with NetworkManager.
 .
 Optional dependencies:
  * ppp: Required for establishing dial-up connections (e.g. via GSM).
  * dnsmasq-base/iptables: Required for creating Ad-hoc connections and
    connection sharing.
  * libteam-utils: Network Team driver allows multiple network interfaces to be
    teamed together and act like a single one. This process is called "ethernet
    bonding", "channel teaming" or "link aggregation".

Package: network-manager-config-connectivity-debian
Architecture: all
Multi-Arch: foreign
Depends: ${misc:Depends},
         network-manager (>= ${source:Version})
Description: NetworkManager configuration to enable connectivity checking
 This package contains a configuration file which enables NetworkManager's
 connectivity checking functionality.
 .
 NetworkManager will try to connect to a Debian server to determine the
 connection status.
 .
 This is particularly useful for captive portal detection.
 .
 No user data is transmitted in the connectivity checks, but merely contacting
 the Debian connectivity check servers reveals that the user is running a
 Debian(-based) operating system with NetworkManager.
